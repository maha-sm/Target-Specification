# Target-Specification

## _program used_
* _nmap_

## _what is nmap?_
#### Gordon Lyon designed Nmap (Network Mapper), a free and open-source network scanner (also known by his pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich). Nmap is a program that sends packets and analyzes the answers to find hosts and services on a computer network.

## _how does nmap work?_
#### Nmap is easy to use, and the majority of the tools it offers are familiar to system administrators from other programs. Nmap has the advantage of combining a variety of these capabilities into a single package, rather than forcing you to switch between other network monitoring programs. You must be comfortable with command-line interfaces in order to use Nmap. Although most sophisticated users can develop scripts to automate routine operations, basic network monitoring does not require this.

## _what seperates nmap from other scanners?_
#### The best thing about Nmap is itâ€™s free and open source and is very flexible and versatile. Nmap is often used to determine alive hosts in a network, open ports on those hosts, services running on those open ports, and version identification of that service on that port. It can also run vulnerability assessment scripts to determine if a service is vulnerable. It can be used by penetration testers to identify open ports to gather more information about a target, or can be used by a security administrator to identify open ports in their systems but are not in use. With its usefulness, the security community have long accepted that Nmap is the de-facto tool for network mapping and host identification.

## _nmap syntax_
#### Now before we dive to examples, we want to break down how Nmap syntax is usually structured, as it is good practice to have this by memory. Although in our experience, sequence of flags is not that important(there are cases they are) most of the time. In fact, for a scan to proceed, Nmap only needs a target. This format is vague and is not required, but according to documentation, Nmap follows the format:

## _basic scans_
#### Nmap has fairly intelligent defaults set, so you are able to just open up Nmap and run a scan without specifying anything but the target. So, why not try it out on a computer on your network. Scanning the computer running Kali isn't going to give you much of anything, so it's best to pick another computer that you own. If you already know the IP of one, awesome. If not, Nmap has a tool to get the IP addresses of the computers on your network.

#### What you'll see when Nmap finishes is a list of every devices that was reachable. Each device will have a name(if applicable), IP address, and MAC address with a manufacturer. By using the names and the hardware manufacturers, you should be able to tell what each device on your network is. Pick a computer that you own, and scan it.

#### You can just write in the IP of that computer. Nmap will take a few seconds to probe the computer with packets and report back.
The report will be sort, but it will contain a list of ports with their state and which service they correspond to. It will also show that MAC address information and your IP again.
## _Useful Flags_
#### Even though the defaults do give some useful information, and you can tell which ports are open, it would still be nice to get some more data. Nmap has tons of flags that you can set to specify just how you would like it to run. There are way too many to cover in this basic guide, but you can always check out Nmap's detailed manpage for more.

## _-sS_
#### The -sS flag is the default scanning flag for Nmap. It just specifies the way that Nmap will scan. Even though it's the default, it's probably a good idea to specify it anyway.

## _-T_
#### Timing can be important. Not only does the timing of the scan determine how long scanning will take, but it can also be instrumental in triggering or not triggering firewalls and other safeguards on a target system. While Nmap offers more fine-grained timing control, it also provides a set of six pre-built timing schemes with the -T flag. These timings range from 0 through 5, with 0 being the slowest and least invasive and 5 being the fastest and most overt. -T3 is the default timing flag, but many users prefer -T4 to speed up the scan.

## _-iL_
#### You can use Nmap to scan multiple targets at once. Doing so can easily be done in-line when you run Nmap.
